Start Guide
===========

  Unless Momentics (or any previous version of this plugin) was used before, few extra
MANUAL steps have to be made before this package works smoothly without errors and warnings.

1) Ensure BlackBerry Native SDK (NDK) is installed. It can be any available edition:
    - distributed by BlackBerry as Gold 3.0+ as MSI installer (https://developer.blackberry.com/native/articles/),
    - via Momentics,
    - BBNDK_VS - compacted NDK skeleton - available as separate part of this plugin at
                 https://github.com/phofman/vs-plugin/releases/tag/v3.0.1-bbndk.
   They all provide respective compilers, libraries and headers required to build projects.
   The last option is preferred as it enables UI inside the Visual Studio to manipulate NDKs and download any
   future releases with minimal effort.

2) Ensure MSBuild extensions are installed.
   Since the version *v3.4* of this plugin, they are automatically populated from inside Visual Studio by custom utility
   called *CodeTitans MSBuild Platform Installer*. However administrator privileges are required to complete the process.
   It is enough to double-click the error message about missing/incompatible version of MSBuild extensions for BlackBerry
   installed, appearing in "Error List" window to initiate and complete the process.

   For convenience those extensions are also distributed separately at https://github.com/phofman/vs-plugin/releases/latest.
   They need to be copied into "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild".
   Without them it won't be possible to create new projects, compile and deploy applications.

In case of any problems, please visit the wiki pages at https://github.com/phofman/vs-plugin/wiki/Installation
or https://github.com/phofman/vs-plugin/wiki/ for general details and documentation.


Also note, that the plugin doesn't spy on you. It doesn't collect any usage statistics, nor send any crash-reports.
Then if you want anything fixed or imporved visit the project page at https://github.com/phofman/vs-plugin/.
