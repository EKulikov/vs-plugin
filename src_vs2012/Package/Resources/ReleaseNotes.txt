Changes in this version:
 * .bar file editor is not default one for all XML files anymore!
 * improved presentation of compilation errors (#35) to let Visual Studio jump into right place in source-code
 * totally changed the way importing Momentics project works:
   - loads original project name (#34)
   - loads properties from manifest.properties too
   - can check/uncheck/remove files by whole folders (#35)
   - can specify custom list of defines (among the ones read from existing settings)
   - can specify custom references to libraries
   - detects the output location by parsing bar-descriptor.xml (using new MSBuild properties: $(TargetArchPre) / $(TargetArchPost) to build that path)

 * added project template of Qt4 on PlayBook (experimental)
 * fixed problem with launching slog2info on PlayBook (it's simply not supported there)
 * other small tweaks and refactorings
