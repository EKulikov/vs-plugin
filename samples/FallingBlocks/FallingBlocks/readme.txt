FallingBlocks

========================================================================
Sample Description:
 
 The Falling Blocks example is a simple application that displays moving colored blocks on the screen.
 The blocks always move towards the side of the device that is angled down, and once they reach 
 the edge of the screen, they wrap around and start again from the opposite edge. As you rotate 
 or turn the device, the blocks change direction to reflect the new orientation.
 	
 Each time you tap the screen, a new block is rendered in the location that you touched, which then
 starts moving along with the rest of the blocks.
