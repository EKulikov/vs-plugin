Please note that the 'bin' and 'lib' folders must be copied to either of the following directories:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Research In Motion\VSPlugin-NDK
C:\Program Files\Research In Motion\VSPlugin-NDK

This will be done by InstallShield when the installer is available, but for now we have to do it manually.
